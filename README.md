# guiCMD
TCL based framework for quickly writing a gui that runs a script or other such functions.  I generally never consider these 'public' but private scripts that I wanted for some purpose that was usually quite small.  But I see the value in the framework to others.  It has not been developed in many years, but I have used it since its inception and have found it useful.
